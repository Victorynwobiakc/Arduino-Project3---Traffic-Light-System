# Arduino Project 3 – Traffic Light System 🚦

This project simulates a basic **traffic light system** using an Arduino.  
It’s a step up from the blinking LED project and introduces the idea of controlling **multiple outputs with timing sequences**.

## 🛠️ What I Learnt
- How to control multiple LEDs with Arduino  
- Using `digitalWrite()` and `delay()` for sequences  
- Basics of simulating real-world systems

## 🔌 Components Used
- 1 x Arduino Mega board  
- 1 x Red LED  
- 1 x Yellow/Amber LED  
- 1 x Green LED  
- 3 x 220Ω resistors  
- Breadboard + jumper wires
